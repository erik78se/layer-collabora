  Collabora Online Development Edition (or "CODE"),
  is the lightweight, or "home" edition of the commercially-supported Collabora Online platform.

  It's basically the LibreOffice interface in a web-browser.

  CODE is not a standalone app, it's a backend intended to be accessed via "WOPI" from an existing interface
  (E.g. Nextcloud)
