# Overview

This collabora charm is intended to be used with [nextcloud](https://jujucharms.com/new/u/erik-lonroth/nextcloud/0)
with a ssl-termination-proxy in front to bring some security to the installation.

A typical setup is with Nextcloud, Collabora & [SSL termination proxy](https://jaas.ai/ssl-termination-proxy/) looks like this.

```
                [router: 176.10.144.22]
                          |
                          |
               [ssl-termination-proxy:443]
       nextcloud.mydomain.com,collabora.mydomain.com      
              |                     |
              |                     |
              |                     |
     [nextcloud.localdomain:80]    [collabora.localdomain:80]

```

juju relate postgresql:db nextcloud:postgres

juju deploy cs:~erik-lonroth/collabora

```

After configuring collabora, try create a "ods" document from your browser and it should work. (Its known to fail the first time for some reason, 
but try a few times if it fails.)

## Known Limitations and Issues

Does not use SSL. Should have a SSL-termination proxy in front.
